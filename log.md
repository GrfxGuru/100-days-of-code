# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Initial fork of the 100 Days repository.

**Thoughts:** Not having taken part in this project before, I thought the set-up rules were pretty straight forward. Would be nice to have a clean Git history to start with, but not a big deal.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Xcode Project Created
- Created the Xcode Master / Detail project.
- Removed code from template project that is not needed, including a display label from the detail view and NSDateObject from the master list.
- Added a new value object class to hold a note.
- Refactored project structure to organize code better.

**Thoughts:** Initial application creation can be annoying sometimes when you start from a template, removing code and keeping the build working can take longer than it should.
